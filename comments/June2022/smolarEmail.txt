Piotr:

Please find attached the PDF file with my comments summarizing my perception of the revised version.  I read this version
as a new paper. I'll do this with all papers (including mine), because I appreciate papers differently at each reading.  

Hilary, 2006 IJNMF paper ( https://doi.org/10.1002/fld.1071 ) is a review of MPDATA authored only by me. It contains some 
discussions pertinent to the thread of flow solenoidality addressed in my review.
